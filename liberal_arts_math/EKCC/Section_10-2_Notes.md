## Assignment Objectives
1. Identify and express angles using proper notation.
2. Classify angles by their measurement.
3. Solve application problems involving angles.
4. Compute angles formed by transversals to parallel lines.
5. Solve application problems involving angles formed by parallel lines.

## Main Ideas
- Angles are important for many applications of geometry.

## Instructions
1. Read the following parts of Section 10.2 of *Contemporary Mathematics*, staring on page 1007:
  - Classifying Angles (Don't worry about the radian stuff. Radians are great for Calculus, but you won't need it anywhere else.)
  - Notation
  - Adjacent Angles
  - Supplementary Angles (Don't worry about the algebra stuff.)
  - Complementary Angles (Again, don't worry about the algebra stuff.)
  - Vertical Angles
  - Transversals
  - Alternate Interior Angles
  - Alternate Exterior Angles
  - Corresponding Angles
  (Skip "Defining Union and Intersection of Sets")
2. Read through examples 10.7, 10.10, 10.11, 10.12, 10.13, 10.14.
3. Work through Your Turn 10.7, 10.10, 10.11, 10.12, 10.13, 10.14. Compare your answers to the answer key on page 1541.
4. Do "Check Your Understanding" problems 10-16 on Page 1017. Compare your answer to the answer key on page 1546.
5. Do the Angles Assignment.
6. Do the Angles Practice Quiz. (Optional but encouraged)
7. Do the Angles Quiz
