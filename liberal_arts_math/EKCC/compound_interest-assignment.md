In the following exercises, rewrite the percent in decimal form.

11\. Principal = \$13,800, annual interest rate = 2.55%, compounded
quarterly, for 18 years

12\. Principal = \$150,000, annual interest rate = 2.95%, compounded
quarterly, for 30 years

13\. Principal = \$3,500, annual interest rate = 2.9%, compounded
monthly, for 7 years

14\. Principal = \$1,500, annual interest rate = 3.23%, compounded
monthly, for 30 years.

19\. Future value = \$1,500,000, annual interest rate = 4.81%,
compounded quarterly, for 35 years

20\. Future value = \$750,000, annual interest rate = 3.95%, compounded
quarterly, for 10 years

21\. Future value = \$600,000, annual interest rate = 3.79%, compounded
monthly, for 17 years

22\. Future value = \$800,000, annual interest rate = 4.23%, compounded
monthly, for 35 years
