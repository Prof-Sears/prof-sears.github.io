# Liberal Arts Mathematics Supplemental Lab Week 2 Information

1. What were some issues you faced with your math classes this week?
2. What were some successes in your math classes this week?
3. This week's assignments will use exponents. Exponents are notation for repeated multiplications. For example:
* 2^5 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 32
* 1.04^3 = 1.04 * 1.04 * 1.04 = 1.124864
That last one takes a while to type on a calculator. There is an exponent key on the calculator app on your tablet. Use your calculator to compute the following. Round your answers for 3 and 4 to five decimal places.
  1. 5^3
  2. 7^4
  3. 1.2^5
  4. 1.06^12
