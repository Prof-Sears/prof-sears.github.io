## Assignment Objectives
1. Determine the difference in interest between simple and compound calculations.
2. Understand and compute future value.
3. Compute present value.

## Main Ideas
- Compound interest is the most common form of interest.
- Compound interest builds much faster than simple interest.
- If you don't pay off a credit card or use one payday loan to cover a different loan, you are paying compound interest. Both situations can get you in trouble very quickly.
