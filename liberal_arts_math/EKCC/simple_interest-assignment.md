#19 should be \$7,274.78 ( FV = 5300\*(1 + 0.0207\*18) = 5300\*1.3726 =
7274.78 )

#21 should be \$5,957.00 ( FV = 5600\*(1 + 0.0255\*30/12) =
5600\*1.06375 = 5957 )

#22 should be \$10,248.75 ( FV = 10000\*(1 + 0.0199\*15/12) =
10000\*1.024875 = 10248.75 )

#51 should be \$2,888.75 ( FV = 2500\*(1 + 0.0311\*5) = 2500\*1.1555 =
2888.75 )

#41 should be \$12,658.23 ( PV = 25000 / (1 + 0.065\*15) = 25000 / 1.975
= 12658.22785..., Round up to 12658.23 )

#42 should be \$8,275.87 ( PV = 12000 / (1 + 0.045\*10) = 12000 / 1.45 =
8275.862069..., Round up to 8275.87 )

#43 should be \$9,615.39 ( PV = 15000 / (1 + 0.035\*16) = 15000 / 1.56 =
9615.384615..., Round up to 9615.39 )

#55 should be \$11,771.64 ( PV = 20000 / (1 + 0.0466\*15) = 20000 /
1.699 = 11771.63037..., Round up to 11771.64 )
