# Solving Problems Involving Direct Translation

## Examples

#. The sum of twice a number and 7 is equal to the sum of the number and 6. Find the number.

# Solve Problems Involving Relationships Among Unknown Quantities

## Examples

#.  In the 2016 Summer Olympics, the U.S. team won 20 more gold medals than the Chinese team.
    If the total number of gold medals won by both teams was 72, find the number of gold medals won by both teams.

# Use Formulas to Solve Problems

## Definition - Formulas

* A **formula** is a known relationship among quantities.
* Many formulas are given as equations.

## Examples

Substitute the given values into each formula and solve for the unknown variable.

#. $S=4lw+2wh$, $s=102$, $l = 7$, $w = 3$.
\vspace\fill

#. $A = \frac12 h (B - b)$, $A = 60$, $B = 7$, $b = 3#

# Solve a Formula or Equation for One of Its Variables

## How To - Solve a Formula for a Variables

#. Multiply on both sides to clear the equation of fractions if they appear.
#. Use the distributive property to remove parentheses if they appear.
#. Simplify each side of the equation by combining like terms.
#. Get all terms containing the specified variable on one side and all other terms on the other side by using the addition property of equality.
#. Get the specified variable alone by using the multiplication property of equality.

## Examples

Solve each formula for the specified variable.

#. $3x + y = 7$ for $y$
\vspace\fill

#. $A = P + PRT$ for $T$.
