<ol type="1">
<li><p>A pole leans away from the sun at an angle of 7° to the vertical,
as shown below. When the elevation of the sun is 55°, the pole casts a
shadow 42 feet long on the level ground. How long is the pole? Round the
answer to the nearest tenth.<br />

alt="A triangle within a triangle. The outer triangle is formed by vertices A, B, and S (the sun). Side A B is the horizontal base, the ground, and is 42 feet. Angle A is 55 degrees. The inner triangle is formed by vertices A, B, and C. Side B C is the pole. Vertex C is located on side A S of the outer triangle between vertices A and S. Angle C B S is 7 degrees." /></p></li>
<li><p>Suppose two radar stations located 20 miles apart each detect an
aircraft between them. The angle of elevation measured by the first
station is 35 degrees, whereas the angle of elevation measured by the
second station is 15 degrees. Find the altitude of the aircraft.<br />

alt="A diagram of a triangle where the vertices are the first ground station, the second ground station, and the airplane in the air between them. The angle between the first ground station and the plane is 15 degrees, and the angle between the second station and the airplane is 35 degrees. The side between the two stations is of length 20 miles. There is a dotted altitude line perpendicular to the ground side connecting the airplane vertex with the ground." /></p></li>
<li><p>A communications tower is located at the top of a steep hill, as
shown below. The angle of inclination of the hill is 67°. A guy wire is
to be attached to the top of the tower and to the ground, 165 meters
downhill from the base of the tower. The angle formed by the guy wire
and the hill is 16°. Find the length of the cable required for the guy
wire to the nearest whole meter.<br />

style="width:2.5in;height:2.90625in"
alt="A triangle formed by the bottom of the hill, the base of the tower at the top of the hill, and the top of the tower. The side between the bottom of the hill and the top of the tower is wire. The length of the side bertween the bottom of the hill and the bottom of the tower is 165 meters. The angle formed by the wire side and the bottom of the hill is 16 degrees. The angle between the hill and the horizontal ground is 67 degrees. " /></p></li>
<li><p>A surveyor has taken the measurements shown below. Find the
distance across the lake. Round answers to the nearest tenth.<br />
<img src="MAT155-17-Oblique_Triangle_Applications/media/image4.jpeg"
style="width:3.58333in;height:2.6875in"
alt="A triangle. One angle is 70 degrees with opposite side unknown, which is the length of the lake. The other two sides are 800 and 900 feet." /></p></li>
<li><p>A satellite calculates the distances and angle shown below (not
to scale). Find the distance between the two cities. Round answers to
the nearest tenth.<br />

alt="Insert figure(table) alt text: A triangle formed by two cities on the ground and a satellite above them. The angle by the satellite is 2.1 degrees with opposite side unknown, which is the distance between the two cities. The lengths of the other sides are 370 and 350 km." /></p></li>
<li><p>A 113-foot tower is located on a hill that is inclined 34° to the
horizontal, as shown below. A guy-wire is to be attached to the top of
the tower and anchored at a point 98 feet uphill from the base of the
tower. Find the length of wire needed.<br />

style="width:5.07292in;height:2.78125in"
alt="Insert figure(table) alt text: Two triangles, one on top of the other. The bottom triangle is the hill inclined 34 degrees to the horizontal. The second is formed by the base of the tower on the incline of the hill, the top of the tower, and the wire anchor point uphill from the tower on the incline. The sides are the tower, the incline of the hill, and the wire. The tower side is 113 feet and the incline side is 98 feet." /></p></li>
