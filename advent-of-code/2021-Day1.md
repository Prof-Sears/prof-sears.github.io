## Input of the data
Since the data for the puzzles are lines of text, we can input the data the same way each time.


```python
f = open("input.txt", "r")
lines = f.read().split("\n")

# convert all strings to integers.
numbers = [int(i) for i in lines]
print("Data length {0}".format(len(numbers)))
```

    Data length 2000
    

## Solve Part 1
The solution to Part 1 involves looping through almost all of the data. We will compare the current entry to the previous entry. We will count the number of times the numbers increase.


```python
increases = 0
for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
    if numbers[i] > numbers[i-1]:
        increases += 1
        
print("Solution to Part 1 {0}".format(increases))
```

    Solution to Part 1 1602
    

## Solve Part 2

The solution to Part 2 is almost the same as for Part 1. A key shortcut is to realize that you don't really have to add all three numbers in the sliding window. You can compare the first number in the old window to the last number in the new window. This is because there are two terms common in each sum.


```python
increases = 0
for i in range(3, len(numbers)):
    if numbers[i] > numbers[i-3]:
        increases += 1
        
print("Solution to Part 2 {0}".format(increases))
```

    Solution to Part 2 1633
