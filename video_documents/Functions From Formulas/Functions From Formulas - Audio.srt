1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
Let’s start with functions from formulas.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:09,590
This is the most common way to use functions in an algebra class, even if it’s not the most common outside of algebra class.

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:15,720
To evaluate a function from a formula, first substitute the input value in the formula.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,440
Then calculate the result.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:25,890
For our first example, start with the function h of p equals p squared plus 2 p.

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,870
We are told to evaluate h of 4. The

7
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,710
The variable p in this formula is a placeholder.

8
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:37,950
Wherever there is a p, we are going to put a 4 in its place.

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:44,350
The final step is to calculate 4 squared plus 2 times 4.

10
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,130
The value of h of 4 is 24.

11
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:57,780
For the second example, the function is f of x equals 3 over 6 plus 2 to the x power.

12
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,250
This time, we will evaluate f of 3.2.

13
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,450
Again, x is a place holder.

14
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:09,710
Substitute 3.2 for x.

15
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,410
The exponent is first.

16
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:17,890
Raise 2 to the 3.2 power to get 9.190.

17
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,640
You will need to use a calculator for this step.

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,910
Keep the results in the calculator, so it keeps track of all the decimals for you.

19
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,450
I only write three decimals while showing work.

20
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,340
I will round after the last step.

21
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,260
Next, add in the denominator.

22
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,420
Finally, divide.

23
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:46,530
The value of f of 3.2 is 0.198.

24
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,530
Use the directions on WebAssign to round to the correct number of decimal digits.

25
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,760
For our last example, we’ll look at an application of functions.

26
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,160
This will be very similar to the types of problems we’ll ask all semester.

27
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:17,600
The number N of deer present in a nature preserve after t years is given by N equals 10.3 over 0.03 plus 0.55 to the t power.

28
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,960
The first part asks how many deer were initially at the preserve.

29
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:29,510
When a problem asks for an “initial value”, the value of the input variable is 0.

30
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,300
Substitute 0 for t.

31
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,850
Any number (except 0) raised to the 0 power is 1.

32
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,570
Add in the denominator.

33
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,460
Finally, divide.

34
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,540
There were 10 deer initially on the preserve.

35
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:53,690
For part b, we are told to evaluate N of 15 and explain the meaning.

36
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,210
Again, substitute 15 for t.

37
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:03,350
Performing the exponent gives 0.00013.

38
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,390
This is a time when keeping your work in the calculator will help you.

39
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,740
Add in the denominator.

40
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,980
Finally, divide.

41
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:18,540
The value of N of 15 is 341.88.

42
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,610
This is the result of the algebra, but it is not the end of the directions.

43
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,420
We will find our answer to the nearest whole number.

44
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:37,080
In the context of the problem, the value of N of 15 means there are 342 deer on the preserve after 15 years.

45
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,760
For part c, we’re told to express the number of deer after 20 years in function notation.

46
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,840
Then we will calculate that value.

47
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,060
I find students miss this first part because they are focused on doing the calculations.

48
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,840
I will take off points if you forget the first part.

49
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:02,210
In function notation, the number of deer on the preserve after 20 years is written as N of 20.

50
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,630
There is nothing else to write for that piece.

51
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,740
To calculate the value, substitute 20 for t.

52
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:14,180
This calculation will look very similar to the last calculation.

53
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,070
First do the exponent.

54
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,450
This is a very small decimal.

55
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,240
Second, perform the addition.

56
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,220
Third, divide.

57
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,910
The result of the calculation is 343.26.

58
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:35,900
Round this answer to 343 deer.

59
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:43,250
The last part of this question asks how much the population increased from the 15th year to the 20th year.

60
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,830
This isn’t difficult, but we must go an extra layer deep to answer the question.

61
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:55,800
The increase will be the population in the 20th year minus the population in the 15th year.

62
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,190
Written in function notation, that is N of 20 minus N of 15.

63
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:08,130
We calculated the function values in the last two parts, so we’ll reuse those values.

64
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,270
We’re not going to use the rounded values for now.

65
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:16,720
Subtracting the function values gives 1.38 for the answer.

66
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:23,820
This means that the population increased by one deer over the time interval.
