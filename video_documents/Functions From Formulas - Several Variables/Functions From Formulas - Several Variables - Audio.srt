00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,060
Let’s continue with functions from formulas by talking about functions with more than one independent variable.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:13,330
The process of evaluating a function with more than one independent variable is the same as with one variable.

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,900
Just be careful to substitute the values in the right place.

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:30,600
For this first example, calculate g of 7 and 3 if g of x and y equals 3 plus x over y minus 8.

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,680
We are going to substitute 7 and 3 into the formula for x and y.

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,490
Substitute 7 for x because x is the first variable in the function.

7
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:46,020
Substitute 3 for y because y is the second variable in the function.

8
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,450
Now that we have the substitutions correct, we will calculate the value.

9
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:56,890
Add in the numerator and subtract in the denominator to get 10 over negative 5.

10
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,650
Divide to get a final answer of negative 2.

11
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:05,850
For the second example, we will look at the apparent magnitude of celestial objects.

12
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,930
The apparent magnitude of a star is its brightness measured on Earth.

13
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,820
Brighter stars have lower magnitudes.

14
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:22,070
The OpenStax Astronomy book give this formula for the ratio of the brightness of two celestial objects.

15
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:32,660
We are going to simplify it as R equals 2.512 to the power of m sub 1 minus m sub 2.

16
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:39,980
Notice that we subtract the magnitudes and then use the difference as an exponent.

17
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:45,970
The apparent magnitude of the planet Venus is negative 4.92 at its brightest.

18
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:51,120
The apparent magnitude of the star Sirius is negative 1.47.

19
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:57,920
We want to write the ratio of the brightness of Venus to Sirius in function notation.

20
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,410
After that, we will calculate that value.

21
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,770
Our textbook has a bad habit of writing a formula without using proper function notation.

22
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:20,030
We will correct that by writing R of m sub 1 and m sub 2 equals 2.512 raised to the power of m sub 1 minus m sub 2.

23
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:28,810
Remember that the brighter star is m sub two and it is on the right of the subtraction.

24
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:36,950
To write the ratio in function notation, write R of negative 1.47 and negative 4.92.

25
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:41,440
You do not need to do any calculations in this part.

26
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,710
To do the calculations, substitute in the values.

27
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:54,070
Subtracting negative 4.92 from negative 1.47 gives positive 3.45.

28
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,240
Be careful with the signs here.

29
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:05,100
Finally, 2.512 to the 3.45 power equals 23.99.

30
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:11,080
This means that Venus is 23.99 times brighter than Sirius.
