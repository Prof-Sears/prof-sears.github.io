00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,990
These are the required calculators for College Algebra.

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,200
You will need to have one of the following:

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,480
TI-83 Plus.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,310
Plus TI-84.

00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,490
Plus TI-84 Plus Silver Edition.

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,920
TI-84 Plus CE.

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,040
We are going to use a lot of features of these calculators in this class.

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,060
You can get them used at reasonable prices.

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,480
They are also common in high school, so you may be able to borrow one.

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,120
A cell phone calculator is not appropriate for this class.
