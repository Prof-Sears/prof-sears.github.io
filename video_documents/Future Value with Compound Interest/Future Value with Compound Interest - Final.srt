00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,070
The topic of this video is calculating future value with compound interest.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,270
In this class, we are going to do the most algebra with the compound interest formula.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,990
Calculating future value will be the most direct use of this formula.

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,430
This is the compound interest formula.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:23,570
A equals P times parentheses 1 plus r over n to the n times t power.

6
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,760
A is the future value.

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,780
P is the present value or principal.

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,590
r is the annual interest rate, written as a decimal.

9
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,100
n is the number of compounding periods per year.

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,320
t is time in years.

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,410
There are different versions of this formula.

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,880
I am using the version found in the OpenStax contemporary mathematics book.

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,000
All versions give the same answers.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,870
In this problem, we want to calculate the future value of an account with compound interest.

15
00:00:53,870 --> 00:01:04,270
The principal is $3000, annual interest rate is 3%, compounding is quarterly, and the term is 4 years.

16
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:07,120
Start this problem by substituting the values.

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:13,830
Use 0.03 for r because that is the decimal equivalent of 3%.

18
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,780
Quarterly compounding means interest is added to the account four times each year.

19
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,230
So, n is 4.

20
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,750
The first operations are inside the parentheses.

21
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,600
Divide 0.03 by 4.

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,030
You can multiply 4 and 6 in the exponent at the same time.

23
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:40,300
Add 1 and 0.0075.

24
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,120
We’re done with the parentheses.

25
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,620
The next operation is raising 1.0075 to the 24 power.

26
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,840
I wrote five decimal digits after taking the exponent.

27
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,070
Keep the results in your calculator so it can worry about all the decimal digits.

28
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,390
Round your answer in the final step.

29
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:03,600
The last operation is to multiply 3000 times the decimal.

30
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,450
The future value is $3589.24.

31
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:16,190
All problems involving calculating future value with compound interest follow these steps.

32
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,130
The only thing that changes are the starting numbers.
