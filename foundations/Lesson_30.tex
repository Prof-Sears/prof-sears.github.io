\begin{enumerate}
	\item Simplify. $$\sqrt{36}\div\sqrt{9}+2^2\cdot7-17$$ \vspace\fill
	\item Find the prime factorization of the following number. Write any repeated factors using exponents. $$588$$ \vspace\fill
	\item Multiply. Write the answer in simplest form. $$1 \frac16\cdot \frac6{49}$$ \vspace\fill
	\item Divide. Write your answer in simplest form. $$ \frac2{33} \div \frac{10}{143}$$ \vspace\fill
	\item Add and simplify. $$\frac3{66} + \frac3{55}$$ \vspace\fill \pagebreak
	\item A landscape architect is planning a border for a flower garden shaped like a triangle.
		The sides of the garden measure 16.2 feet, 24.66 feed, and 22.8 feet. Find the amount of border material needed.\\

	\item A self-tanning lotion advertises that a 2-oz bottle will provide four applications. Jen found a great deal on a 13-oz bottle of the self-tanning lotion she had been using. Based on advertising claims, how many applications of the self-tanner should Jen expect?\vspace\fill
	\item In 1999, total revenue of a music company from music sales and licensing was \$14.3 billion. It was forecasted that this number would continue to drop until it reached \$5.5 billion in 2014. Find this percent decrease in music revenue.\vspace\fill
	\item The sales tax is \$115.50 on a stereo system purchase of \$1650. Find the sales tax rate. \vspace\fill
	\item Sketch the right triangle and find the length of the side not given. (Each length is in units.) $$\text{leg}=10 \text{, leg}=12$$ \vspace\fill \pagebreak
	\item Decide whether the given number is a solution of the given equation. $$ \frac{x}2 - 1= -2; \qquad x=6$$ \vspace\fill
	\item Solve the equation. $$-4(n-2)=6-3n$$ \vspace\fill
	\item Solve the equation. $$6x+1=9x+7$$ \vspace\fill
	\item Solve the equation for $x$. $$ \frac34 x - \frac12=7$$ \vspace\fill \pagebreak
