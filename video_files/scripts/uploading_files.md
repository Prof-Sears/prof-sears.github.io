# Uploading Files to Blackboard - Script

For a few of your assignments, you are required to upload a file to show your work.
This video will show how to upload files to Blackboard.

Here is a Blackboard shell for one of my classes.
I'm going to open one assignment.
Click "Start attempt" on the lower right.

There are four questions in this assignment.
I will put guesses for the answers just to speed up this video.

At the very bottom of the assignment is "Additional content".
This is where you upload files.

You can drag a file into this box to attach it to the assignment.
This is on my Linux desktop at home.
This works on both Windows and MacOS computers.
I haven't tried it on ChromeOS, but I'm confident it will work.

The other option is to click the paper clip icon in the text box.
That will open a file dialog to select the file.
This is probably the only option if you are using a tablet or smartphone to work on Blackboard.

Once the file is attached and you have finished the other work for the assignment, click "Submit" on the lower right.

That's all there is to uploading files to Blackboard.
