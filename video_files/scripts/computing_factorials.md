A factorial is a mathematical function that is common in counting problems.
Factorials are one of those topics that seem hard at first, but get easier the more you work with them.
There are short cuts that make these problems go quickly.

In general, to calculate the factorial of a whole number n, you multiply together every whole number less than or equal to n.
This is written as n factorial equals n times n minus 1 times n minus 2 down to 1.

For a first example, let's calculate 4 factorial.
Following the defintion, 4 factorial is 4 times 3 times 2 times 1.
These mutliply together to get 24.
So, 4 factorial is 24.

This second example asks us to calculate 8 factorial divided by 6 factorial.
We'll start by expanding out 8 factorial in the numerator and 6 factorial in the denominator.

Don't be tempted to do these mutliplicatons first!
Remember that you can cancel a common factor from both the numerator and denominator.

This means that we can cancel the sixes from the top and the bottom, as well as the fives, fours, threes, and twos.
The ones really don't do anything because we're multiplying.

What's left is 8 times 7, which is 56. 56 is the answer to the problem.

You may have noticed that there is a shortcut to this problem.
8 factorial can be written as 8 times 7 times 6 factorial.
This means we could have canceled 6 factorial without writing it out.
This leaves 8 times 7, which is still 56.

Most of the time, you don't see the shortcut until after you do the problem the long way.
That is just part of learning math.

The last problem is to calculate 9 factorial divided by 3 factorial times 4 factorial.
We'll use the shortcut from the last problem to start this one.
Write 9 factorial as 9 times 8 times 7 times 6 times 5 times 4 factorial.
Write out 3 factorial and leave 4 factorial as is.
We can cancel 4 factorial from the top and the bottom.

At this point, we need to manually cancel the 3 and the 2 in the denominator.
3 goes into 9 three times.
2 goes into 8 four times.
There are many correct ways to do this step, so do it any way that works for you.

What's left is 3 times 4 times 7 times 6 times 5.
At this point, I'll break out my calculator.
The answer is 2520.
