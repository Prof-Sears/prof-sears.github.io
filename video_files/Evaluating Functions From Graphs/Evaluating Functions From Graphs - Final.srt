00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,210
Just like evaluating functions from tables, evaluating functions from graphs is something we do regularly.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,270
We don’t think of it as an algebra skill.

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,610
The graph below shows the stock price for Kellanova, formerly Kellogg’s.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,010
The horizontal axis shows the dates.

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,600
The vertical axis shows the stock price.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,240
To find a stock price on a given date, find that date on the horizontal axis and look at the graph above that point.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,050
Look to the vertical axis to find the stock price.

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,000
Graphs are helpful for seeing an overall trend in the function values.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,570
The downside is that it is hard to find exact function values from a graph.

10
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,270
Graphs are very useful when combined with tables or formulas.

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:45,310
Going back to the Kellanova stock, we can tell the story of the price without knowing specific values.

12
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:50,700
The stock price was slightly decreasing between the beginning of June until the end of July.

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,450
Between the end of July and the middle of August, the stock price increased quickly.

14
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,750
After the middle of August, the stock price stayed consistent.

15
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,250
For another example, let’s look at a function more typical of an algebra class.

16
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,180
The green graph defines a function f of x.

17
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,560
Let’s evaluate f of 3 and f of 6.

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,080
For f of 3, look on the horizontal axis to find 3.

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,880
Then, identify the point on the graph with x-coordinate of 3.

20
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,550
The y-coordinate can be read off the vertical axis.

21
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,890
We can say that f of three is about 1.2.

22
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,390
For f of 6, repeat the process.

23
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,470
The value of f of 6 is about 3.8.
