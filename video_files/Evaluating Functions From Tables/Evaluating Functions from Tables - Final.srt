00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
Evaluating functions from tables is a skill we perform on a regular basis.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,950
We just don’t call it that.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,670
We are going to start with the basics now.

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:15,200
At several different points in the semester, we will work on taking a function from a table and creating a formula to describe the table.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,660
The table below gives the cumulative domestic box office for the movie “Inside Out 2”.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,680
The left column is the days the movie was in theaters.

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,980
The right column is the amount of money earned in the US and Canada

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,880
up to and including that date, measured in millions of dollars.

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,850
We can quickly evaluate the function B of t when the value of the independent variable,

10
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,110
that is, the input, is on the table.

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:46,230
For example, we can find B of 12 equals 388.0 right away.

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,600
Finding B of 20 equals 496.5 is just as easy.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,710
Where things get tricky is when we want to know values of the dependent variable,

14
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,090
that is, the output,

15
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,490
when the corresponding value of the independent variable isn’t on the table.

16
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:08,410
For example, finding the exact value of B of 14 isn’t possible with the data we know.

17
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:13,500
We aren’t stuck when the required value of the dependent variable isn’t on the table.

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,060
Notice that 14 is halfway between 12 and 16.

19
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,140
We can use this to make an educated guess about B of 14.

20
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,970
As a rule, if the value x

21
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,310
of the independent variable is halfway between two known values

22
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,130
of the independent variable, x sub 1 and x sub 2,

23
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:40,000
you can approximate the value of f of x by averaging f of x sub 1 and f of x sub 2.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,680
Going back to our original problem, we can approximate the value of B of 14 by averaging B of 12 and B of 16.

25
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:56,390
B of 12 is 388.0. B of 16 is 451.3.

26
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:02,910
Adding those values and dividing by 2 gives an average of 419.65.

27
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:12,880
So, our estimate of the cumulative box office of “Inside Out 2” after 14 days is 419.65 million dollars.

28
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,700
The actual box office is 411.9 million dollars.

29
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,600
That means we weren’t too far off in our estimate.
