00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,220
The average rate of change is a fundamental concept in our College Algebra course.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:09,050
We will cover the average rate of change from several different angles throughout this semester.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,780
For now, we will talk about understanding the average rate of change and how to calculate it.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,310
Before looking at the formula, let’s look at the meaning of the average rate of change.

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,700
This is something that we think about regularly.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,940
Suppose you drove 200 miles in four hours.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:29,070
Intuitively, you recognize that you drove 50 miles per hour on average.

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,670
Even though we’ll add some formality and formulas, the idea behind the average rate of change is exactly this example.

9
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,400
The phrase I use to help students remember the average rate of change is:

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,990
“Change in the outputs divided by the change in the inputs.”

11
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,400
Let’s do an example to see how this works.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:54,190
This table defines a function B of t, where B is the cumulative domestic box office of the movie “Twisters”,

13
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,910
measured in millions of dollars,

14
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,360
and t is the number of days the movie is in theaters.

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,450
Let’s calculate the average rate of change from t equals 1 to t equals 3.

16
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:11,930
The change in the outputs is 81.3 minus 32.1 or 49.2.

17
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,620
The change in the inputs is 3 minus 1 or 2.

18
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:20,710
Dividing 49.2 by 2 gives 24.6.

19
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:28,610
Thus, the cumulative domestic box office of “Twisters” increased by about 24.6 million dollars per day.

20
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,860
Notice that the units of the average rate of change have the word “per”.

21
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,320
This is a hint that the number measures a rate of change.

22
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:43,020
In general, the units for a rate of change are the units of the output “per” the units of the inputs.

23
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,760
The formula for the average rate of change of a function f

24
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,650
from the inputs x sub 1 to x sub 2 is

25
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:57,920
f of x sub 1 minus f of x sub 2 divided by x sub 1 minus x sub 2.

26
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,490
You do not need to be precise on which number is x sub 1 or x sub 2.

27
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,920
If you are consistent, the signs will take care of themselves.

28
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:13,090
Let’s use the formula to calculate the average rate of change from t equals 4 to t equals 7.

29
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:19,850
Using the formula tells us we need to calculate B of 7 minus B of 4 over 7 minus 4.

30
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:28,690
Substituting the values, we now need to calculate 119.6 minus 90.5 divided by 3.

31
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,120
Finishing the calculation gives 9.7.

32
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:41,460
So, we can say that “Twisters” earned about 9.7 million dollars per day on days 5, 6, and 7 of its theatrical run.

33
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,260
To finish, we’ll do an example with functions defined by a formula.

34
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,040
Let f of x be 1 over x minus 2x.

35
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,890
Calculate the average rate of change between x equals 2 and x equals 7.

36
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,840
First, we’ll set up the average rate of change formula.

37
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,610
Calculate f of 7 minus f of 2 divided by 7 minus 2.

38
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,410
f of 2 is -3.5.

39
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:10,060
f of 7 is -13.86 when rounded to two decimal places.

40
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:17,520
-13.86 minus -3.5 is -10.36.

41
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,950
Finally, divide by 5 to get -2.07 after rounding.

42
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,440
The average rate of change can be a negative number.

43
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,130
We’ll talk more about that soon.
