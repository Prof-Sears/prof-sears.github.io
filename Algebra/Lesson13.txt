# Addition and Subtraction Properties of Equality

## Definition - Linear equations
A **linear equation in one variable** has one variable and:

* No exponents on the variable
* No variables in a denominator.

## Subtraction Property of Equality

For any numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$, if $a=b$, then $a−c=b−c$.

**That is, when you subtract the same quantity from both sides of an equation, you still have equality.**

## Addition Property of Equality

For any numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$, if $a=b$, then $a+c=b+c$.

**That is, when you add the same quantity to both sides of an equation, you still have equality.**

## Examples

Solve each equation using the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality.

#. $x + 24 = 35$

#. $y + 45 = - 66$

#. $a - 45 = 76$

#. $m - 18 = -200$

#. $a + \frac 14 = \frac 34$

# Multiplication and Division Properties of Equality

## Division Property of equality

For any numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$, and $c \neq 0$, if $a = b$, then $\frac ac = \frac bc$.

**That is, when you divide both sides of an equation by any non-zero number, you still have equality.**

## Multiplication Property of equality

For any numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$, and $c \neq 0$, if $a = b$, then $ac = bc$.

**That is, when you multiply both sides of an equation by any non-zero number, you still have equality.**

## Examples

Solve the following equation using the Division and Multiplication Properties of Equality.

#. $8x = 56$

#. $-5c = 55$

#. $\frac z2 = 54$

#. $20 = \frac{q}{-5}$

#. $-807 = 15y$

# Simplify Equations and Then Solve

Solve each equation.

#. $c + 31 - 10 = 46$

#. $9x + 5 - 8x + 14 = 20$

#. $6x + 8 - 5x + 16 = 32$

#. $5 \left( y - 6 \right) - 4y = -6$

#. $6 \left( y - 2 \right) - 5 y = 4 \left( y + 3 \right) - 4 \left( y - 1 \right)$

#. $100 - 16 = 4p - 10p -p$

#. $0.25d + 0.10 d = 6 - 0.75$

#. $-10(q - 4) - 57 = 93$

#. $-10 (x + 4) - 19 = 85$

# Translate to and Equation and Solve

## How To - Translate an English Sentence to an Algebraic Equation

#. Locate the “equals” word(s). Translate to an equals sign (=).
#. Translate the words to the left of the “equals” word(s) into an algebraic expression.
#. Translate the words to the right of the “equals” word(s) into an algebraic expression.

## Examples

Translate and solve.

#. Three less than $y$ is $−19$.

#. The sum of $−4n$ and $5n$ is $−82$.

#. Avril rode her bike a total of 18 miles, from home to the library and then to the beach.
   The distance from Avril’s house to the library is 7 miles.
   What is the distance from the library to the beach?

#. Mollie paid $36.25 for 5 movie tickets.
   What was the price of each ticket?

#. Aiden is 27 inches tall.
   He is 38 as tall as his father.
   How tall is his father?
