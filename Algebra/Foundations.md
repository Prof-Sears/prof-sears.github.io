# Foundations of College Algebra

## Lessons

### A Note about Formatting
*  The MS Word version of each lesson handout is the best for people with visual impairments.
   The Microsoft Word "Read Out Loud" feature provides the most correct reading of mathematics.
*  The PDF version is best for printing. It has the cleanest format.
   It is not ADA compliant, so please be careful.
*  The web version is HTML with Mathjax for rendering mathematics.
   I am unsure how well screen readers will cope with the notation.
*  The original markdown is the source of all versions.
   It is not meant for use with students.
