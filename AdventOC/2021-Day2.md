## Input of the data
Since the data for the puzzles are lines of text, we can input the data the same way each time.


```python
f = open("input.txt", "r")
lines = f.read().split("\n")
print("Data length {0}".format(len(lines)))
```

    Data length 1000
    

## Solve Part 1
The solution to Part 1 involves looping through the data. Each line will change the horizontal position or depth. We have to use the first character to determine which value to change. The last character tells the quantity.


```python
horizontal = 0
depth = 0
for l in lines:
    if(l[0] == "f"):
        horizontal += int(l[-1])
    elif(l[0] == "d"):
        depth += int(l[-1])
    else:
        depth -= int(l[-1])

        
print("Solution to Part 1 {0}".format(horizontal * depth))
```

    Solution to Part 1 1714950
    

## Solve Part 2

The solution to Part 2 is almost the same as for Part 1. The difference is that the input changes the aim, depth, and horizontal postions differently than in Part 1.


```python
horizontal = 0
depth = 0
aim = 0
for l in lines:
    if(l[0] == "f"):
        horizontal += int(l[-1])
        depth += aim * int(l[-1])
    elif(l[0] == "d"):
        aim += int(l[-1])
    else:
        aim -= int(l[-1])
        
print("Solution to Part 2 {0}".format(horizontal * depth))
```

    Solution to Part 2 1281977850
