    <h1>Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory</h1>
    <div class="display">
      <p>This page is to solve the programming problem from <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3">Advent of Code - Day 3</a>.</p>
      <p>The problem is to find how risky it is to sled down the mountain to start your vacation.
      The input is a map that gives the locations of the trees down the mountain.
      Because the map is cyclic, modular arithmetic is important for finding your location.
      Part 1 tells us that our sled will go right three units for every unit down.
      Part 2 gives us multiple combinations on the way down.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution is pretty direct, as we move in the indicated fashion while tracking if we have hit a tree or not.
        The code is below the animation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The animation below shows the multiple paths down the mountain.
        Tree encounters are marked in red. Tree misses are marked in white.

      </div>
      <p>The code for counting the tree encounters and solving both parts is below..</p>
      <pre><code>
/**
 * this function checks for trees on the decent.
 */
function checkDescent(deltaX, deltaY) {
  let curX = 0;
  let curY = 0;
  let treeHits = 0;
  while (curY < lines.length) {
    if (lines[curY].charAt(curX % lines[curY].length) === '#') treeHits++;

    curX += deltaX;
    curY += deltaY;
  }
  return treeHits;
}

/**
 * This function solves part 1.
 */
function solvePart1() {
  print(`Part 1 Tree hits: ${checkDescent(3,1)}.`);
}

/**
 * This function solves part 2.
 */
function solvePart2() {
  let product = 1;
  product *= checkDescent(1, 1);
  product *= checkDescent(3, 1);
  product *= checkDescent(5, 1);
  product *= checkDescent(7, 1);
  product *= checkDescent(1, 2);
  print(`Part 2 Tree hits: ${product}`);
}
