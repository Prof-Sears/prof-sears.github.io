## Input of the data
Since the data for the puzzles are lines of text, we can input the data the same way each time.


```python
f = open("input.txt", "r")
lines = f.read().split("\n")
print("Data length {0}".format(len(lines)))
```

    Data length 1000


## Solve Part 1
The solution to Part 1 involves finding the most common bit in each position. If 0 is the most common bit, then we add a 1 to the epsilon number in the corresponding postion. Otherwise, we add the 1 in the corresponding position in the gamma number.

This could probably be done more efficiently with bitmasks.


```python
gamma = 0
epsilon = 0
for i in range(len(lines[0])):
    if len([l for l in lines if l[i] == "0"]) > len(lines)/2:
        epsilon += 2**(11 - i)
    else:
        gamma += 2**(11 - i)
        
print("Part 1 Solution: {}".format(gamma * epsilon))
```

    Part 1 Solution: 3549854


## Solve Part 2

Part 2 involves filtering out values from each list based on the most common bit in each postion. This one was much trickier than Part 1.


```python
oxyList = lines[:]
mc = "0"
pos = 0
while len(oxyList) > 1:
    if len([l for l in oxyList if l[pos] == "0"]) > len(oxyList)/2:
        mc = "0"
    else:
        mc = "1"
    oxyList = [l for l in oxyList if l[pos] == mc]
    # print(len(oxyList))
    pos += 1
oxygen = int(oxyList[0], 2)

co2List = lines[:]
pos = 0
while len(co2List) > 1:
    if len([l for l in co2List if l[pos] == "0"]) > len(co2List)/2:
        mc = "1"
    else:
        mc = "0"
    co2List = [l for l in co2List if l[pos] == mc]
    # print(len(co2List))
    pos += 1
co2 = int(co2List[0], 2)
        
print("Part 2 Solution: {}".format(oxygen * co2))
```

    Part 2 Solution: 3765399
