# Review of Vrew - An AI Video Editing Tool

## Summary

Vrew is an easy to use video editor with the ability to transcribe speech to text and add captions to a video.
This feature makes it a worthwhile tool for educators creating videos for teaching. 
The video editing features are at a bare minimum, but that is a positive for educators.
There are generative AI features built into Vrew, but those are not useful for my needs.

**Disclosure** VoyagerX, the creators of Vrew asked me to write this reveiew.
I have not been compensated for the review.

## Using Vrew

For this review, I decided to make an updated introduction video for my Liberal Arts Mathematics course. I wrote the script, recoreded the video, and saved both to my desktop.

The first step is opening a new project.

There are several options when creating a new project.
I used "Load video-audio from PC".
Many of the other options are useful for creating videos with generative AI features.
I experimented with "Create Video from slides" last year.
The results were passible, but I've decided to stick to my own voice for now on.
(I am not a fan of those types of videos.
Their proliferation on YouTube is one of the reasons I left the platform.)

## Vrew on Linux

Vrew is available on Linux.
It is distributed as a [AppImage](https://appimage.org).
That means running Vrew is a simple as downloading the AppImage file, changing the permission to executable, and running the file.

Because I run [Fedora Sway Atomic](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/sway), which makes extensive use of [Flatpaks](https://flatpak.org), a Flatpak version would be greatly appreciated.
