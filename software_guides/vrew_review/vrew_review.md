# Review of Vrew - An AI Video Editing Tool

## Summary

Vrew is an easy to use video editor with the ability to transcribe speech to text and add captions to a video.
This feature makes it a worthwhile tool for educators creating videos for teaching. 
The video editing features are at a bare minimum, but that is a positive for educators.
There are generative AI features built into Vrew, but I would not use them.

**Disclosure** Voyagex, the creators of Vrew asked me to write this reveiew. I have not been compensated for the review.
