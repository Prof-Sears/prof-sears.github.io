\huge

#.  Assign each state one representative.

#.  Calculate the **priority value** for each state by this formula.
    $$\text{priority value} = \frac{\text{state population}}{\sqrt{\text{current seats}\cdot(\text{current seats} + 1)}}$$

#.  Assign the seat to the state with the highest priority value.

#.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all seats are assigned.
