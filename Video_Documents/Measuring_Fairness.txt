\textbf{\huge Measuring Fairness}

\large

#. **Average Constituency**
$$\text{average constituency} = \frac{\text{population of state}}{\text{number of representatives}}$$

#. Higher average constituency means more poorly represented.

#. **Absolute Unfairness**
$$\text{absolute unfairness} = (\text{larger average constituency}) = (\text{smaller average constituency})$$

#. **Relative Unfairness**
$$\text{relative unfairness} = \frac{\text{absolute unfairness}}{\text{smaller average constituency}}$$
