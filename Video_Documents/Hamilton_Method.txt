\textbf{\huge Hamilton's Method}
\huge

#. Divide total population by number of seats.
   This is the **standard divisor**.
#. Divide each population by the standard divisor.
   This is the **standard quota**.
#. Round each standard quota down.
   This is the **lower quota**.
#. Add one seat to the states, from largest decimal part of the standard quota to smallest, until all seats are given out.
