## 2024 Solar Eclipse

My wife and I got a great view of the solar eclipse on April 8, 2024.
We drove to Muncie, Indiana to see the eclipse from my grandmother's nursing home.
She was happy to show us off to the other residents.
There were several other visitors, so it made for a great crowd.

The skies stayed clear around the sun the entire afternoon.
I attempted a time lapse of the eclipse with one camera.
The reflections from the stacked neutral density filters completely ruined the time lapse.
I had a second camera that I used for photos during totality.
You can see the result above.

This was the first solar eclipse that I got to see in the path of totality.
Seeing the eclipse from totality is an overwhelming experience.
A partial eclipse was visible from my college in 2017.
There is no comparison between the two.
It is completely worth the effort to experience a total eclipse.
