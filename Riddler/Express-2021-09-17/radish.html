    <h1>Babylonian Radish Pie</h1>
    <p>The Riddler Express for September 17, 2021 ask us to iteratively measure flour. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-bake-the-radish-pie/">Can You Bake the Radish Pie?</a>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I recently came across a rather peculiar recipe for something called Babylonian radish pie.
          Intrigued, I began to follow the directions, which said I could start with any number of cups of flour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any number? I mean, I had to start with some flour, so zero cups wasn‚Äôt an option.
          But according to the recipe, any positive value was fair game.
          Next, I needed a second amount of flour that was 3 divided by my original number.
          For example, if I had started with two cups of flour, then the recipe told me I now needed 3 divided by 2, or 1.5, cups at this point.
          I was then instructed to combine these amounts of flour and discard half.
          Apparently, this was my new starting amount of flour.
          I was to repeat the process, combining this amount with 3 divided by it and then discarding half.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recipe told me to keep doing this, over and over. Eventually, I‚Äôd have the proper number of cups of flour for my radish pie.
        </p>
        <p>
          How many cups of flour does the recipe ultimately call for?
        </p>

        One way to solve the problem is to let a program try several different values for the initial amount of flour and follow the process to the end.
        Here is a visualization of that process using a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobweb_plot">web diagram</a>.
      </p>
      
    <div style="text-align: center">
      <iframe width=620 height = 620 src="https://preview.p5js.org/Prof-Sears/embed/GFEXW-W5y"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>The web diagram shows that our process converges to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_(mathematics)">fixed point</a>.
    To calculate the value of the fixed point, we just need a little algebra.
    \[
		\begin{align*}
			\frac12 \left( x + \frac3x \right) &= x \\
			x + \frac3x &= 2x \\
			x^2 + 3 &= 2x^2 \\
			3 &= x^2 \\
			x = \pm \sqrt{3}
		\end{align*}
    \]
    So, our algebraic solution is \( \sqrt{3} = 1.73205\).
    </p>
    <p> (Of course, it helps to read the problem statement correctly.)

		Solving an equation using an iterative method apears in several
		forms. One example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method">Newton's Method</a>.
		To solve the equation \(f(x) = 0\) using Newton's method, start with an initial guess \(x_0\) and the
		repeatedly apply the formula \(x_{n+1}=x_{n} - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'{x_n}}\).
		For the function \(f(x) = x^2 - a\), we get the following.
		\[
			\begin{align*}
				x_{n+1} &= x_n - \frac{{x_n}^2 - a}{2x_n} \\
				&= x_n - \frac{{x_n}^2}{2x_n} + \frac{a}{2x_n} \\
				&= x_n - \frac{x_n}{2} + \frac{a}{2x_n} \\
				&= \frac{x_n}{2} + \frac{a}{2x_n} \\
				&= \frac{1}{2} \left( x_n + \frac{a}(x_n) \right)
			\end{align*}
		\]
		The recipe was Newton's Method all along. The method in the recipe is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Babylonian_method">the Babylonian method for calculating square root.</a>
