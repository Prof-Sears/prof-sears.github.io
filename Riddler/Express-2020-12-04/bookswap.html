    <h1>Book Swap Simulation</h1>
    <p>This is a simulation of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-cut-the-cookies/">Riddler Express for December 4, 2020</a>.
    I'm pretty confident in the answer that I did quickly in my head.
    Experience tells me that with this level of confidence I need to test my answer.</p>
    <p>My original guess is that the probability would be \(\frac{1}{N}\) with \(N\) players.</p>
    <div class="simulation">
      <button onclick="runSimulation()">Run Simulation</button>
      <div id="out" class="output"></div>
    </div>
    <p>Since my initial guess was wildly wrong, I decided to look on the Wikipedia page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derangement">derangements</a>.
    The answer to the problem, and the reason why the probability reaches a limiting value can be found there.</p>
    <p>The solution to the Riddler Express is below.
    \[\frac{!5}{5!} = \frac{44}{120} = \frac{11}{30} = 0.36667\]</p>
    
    <p>This was the first time I used <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> in HTML. I kind of dig it.</p>
