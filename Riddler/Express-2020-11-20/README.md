# Riddler Express Solution - November 20, 2020

## Problem Statement

The full text of this week's Riddler Express can be found at [this link](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-pass-the-cranberry-sauce/).

>Depending on the year, there can be one, two or three Friday the 13ths. Last week happened to be the second Friday the 13th of 2020.
>
>What is the greatest number of Friday the 13ths that can occur over the course of four consecutive calendar years?
>
>Extra credit: What’s the greatest number of Friday the 13ths that can occur over a four-year period (i.e., a period that doesn’t necessarily begin on January 1)?

The solution is presented in my web app at [this link](calendar.html).

(I realize that Excel would be easier. I like using the Riddler to practice my coding skills.)
