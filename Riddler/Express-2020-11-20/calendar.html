	<h1>Searching Friday the 13ths</h1>
	<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
	<p>The full text can be found at <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-pass-the-cranberry-sauce/">
		this link</a>.</p>
			
	<blockquote>
		<p>Depending on the year, there can be one, two or three Friday the 13ths. Last week happened to be the second Friday the 13th of 2020.</p>
		<p>What is the greatest number of Friday the 13ths that can occur over the course of four consecutive calendar years?</p>
		<p>Extra credit: What’s the greatest number of Friday the 13ths that can occur over a four-year period (i.e., a period that doesn’t necessarily begin on January 1)?</p>
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>To solve the problem, we will build calendars in JavaScript. The full source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/Prof-Sears/prof-sears.github.io/tree/main/Riddler/Express-2020-11-20">my GitHub site</a>.</p>

		<h2>Building the Calendars</h2>
		<p>The first task is to build the calendar for this four-year period.
		The calendar will count days in the four-year period, with January 1st corresponding to day 1.</p>
		<p>Leap years add an extra wrinkle to the problem. There are four possible positions for the leap year to fall.
		We will create one calendar for each possible postion of the leap year.</p>
		<p>Click "Build Calendar" to see where the 13th of each month falls in the four year calendar.</p>
		<button id="buildbutton" onclick="buildCalendars()">Build Calendar</button>

	<div id="reducer">
		<h2>Finding Days of the Week</h2>
		<p>The next task is to find the day of the week for the 13th of each month.
		To do this, we will reduce each day modulo 7.</p>
		<p>Rather than worry about which day of the week to assign to 0 mod 7, we'll count the similar days of the week.
		Once we know which day of the week is most common, we'll work backward to make the most common day a Friday.</p>
		<p>Click "Reduce Calendar" to reduce each number in the last calendar modulo 7.</p>
		<button id="reducebutton" onclick="reduceCalendars()" disabled>Reduce Calendar</button>
		<div id="reducerout"></div>
	</div>
	<div id="counter">
		<h2>Count Days of Week for the 13th of Each Month</h2>
		<p>The final step is to count the equivalence classes in the reduced calendar.
		Which ever is the most common will be assigned to Friday.</p>
		<p>Click "Count Days" to count the equivalence classes for each year.</p>
		<button id="countbutton" onclick="countDays()" disabled>Count Days</button>
		<div id="counterout"></div>
	</div>
	<div id="firstcon"></div>
	<div id="extra">
		<h2>Extra Credit</h2>
		<p>For the extra credit portion, we will cycle through all possible start days. We will assume that the first year is a leap year.</p>
		<p>It seems safe to assume that the four-year period with the most Friday the 13ths can start on the 13th of a month.
		If, for example, the four-year period started on the 10th of a month, then we can move the start date back three days and we won't lose any
		Friday the 13ths.</p>
		<p>The calendars we will create will start counting days with the 13th of the start month as day one.
		We will reduce the day numbers modulo 7 to find the days of the week for the 13th of each month.
		We will count the equivalence classes in each four-year period.
		The most common equivalence classes for a four-year period will be the most Friday the 13ths possible in a four-year period.</p>
		<p>Just to be thorough, we will include the option of skipping a leap year.
		We skip a leap year in the first year of a century, except for centuries divisible by 400.</p>
