		<h2>Build Calendar</h2>
		<p>The first task is to build the calendar for this four-year period.
		January 1st of the first year will be day 1.
		There are four possible positions for the leap year to fall.
		Click "Build Calendar" to see where the 13th of each month falls in the four year calendar.</p>
		<button id="buildbutton" onclick="buildCalendars()">Build Calendar</button>

		<h2>Reduce Calendar mod 7</h2>
		<p>The next task is to find the day of the week for the 13th of each month.
		To do this, we will reduce each day modulo 7.
		For now, we won't worry about which day of the week corrsponds to which mod 7 equivalence class.</p>
		<button id="reducebutton" onclick="reduceCalendars()" disabled>Reduce Calendar</button>
		<div id="reducerout"></div>
	</div>
	<div id="counter">
		<h2>Count Days of Week for the 13th of Each Month</h2>
		<p>The final step is to count the equivalence classes in the reduced calendar.
		Which ever is the most common will be assigned to Friday.</p>
