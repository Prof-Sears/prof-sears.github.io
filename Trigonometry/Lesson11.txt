# Introduction

## How To - Solve Linear Trigonometric Equations

To solve an equation of the form $\sin{x} = a$, $\cos{x} = a$, or $\tan{x} = a$ on the interval $0 \leq x < 2\pi$:

#. Use an inverse function to find one solution to the equation.
   Call this solution $x_0$.
#. Find a second solution.
   * For sine, the second solution is $x_1 = \pi - x_0$.
   * For cosine, the second solution is $x_1 = 2\pi - x_0$.
   * For tangent, the second solution is $x_1 = x_0 + \pi$.
#. If you have a negative solution, add $2\pi$ to that solution.
   This adds one period to the sine case.
   It adds two periods when you have a tangent function.
   (We added one period to the solution with a tangent function back in step 2.)

## How To - Find the General Solution to a Trigonometric Equation

#. Find the solutions to the equation on the interval $0 \leq x < 2\pi$. Only use one solution in the case of tangent.
#. Add multiples of the period, $2n\pi$ or $n\pi$ to the solutions from step 1.

## Examples
Solve the following equations on the interval $0 \leq x < 2\pi$. Then find the general solutions.

#. $\sin{\theta} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$

#. $\cos{\theta} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
\vspace{\fill}

#. $\tan{\theta} = -\sqrt{3}$

## General Hints

#. Look for a pattern that suggests an algebraic property, such as the difference of squares or a factoring opportunity.
#. Substitute the trigonometric expression with a single variable, such as x or u.
#. Solve the equation the same way an algebraic equation would be solved.
#. Substitute the trigonometric expression back in for the variable in the resulting expressions.
#. Solve for the angle.

## Examples
Solve the following equations on the interval $0 \leq x < 2\pi$.

#. $4 \sin^2{x} - 2 = 0$.
\vspace{\fill}

#. $\sec{x}\sin{x} - 2 \sin{x} = 0$.
\vspace{\fill}

#. $2 \sin{x} \cos{x} - \sin{x} + 2 \cos{x} - 1 = 0$
\vspace{\fill}

# Equations of Quadratic Type

## Examples
Solve the following equations on the interval $0 \leq x < 2\pi$.

#. $\tan^2{x} - \sqrt{3} \tan{x} = 0$
\vspace{\fill}

#. $\sin^2{x} + \sin{x} - 2 = 0$
\vspace{\fill}

#. $3 \cos^2{x} - 2 \cos{x} - 2 = 0$
