Hi, everybody!

Here is a brief overview of how the course works:

*  There are five units for the course.
*  Each unit is covered over a few weeks.
*  Homework and quizzes are on WebAssign.
   The links for the homework assignments *should* take you to WebAssign.
   (Blackboard can be finicky with links sometimes.)
*  There are three unit projects for the course.
   Directions are posted on Blackboard.

My recommendation is to check with Blackboard on Monday morning each week and make a plan to complete the work for that week. Please try to work at a steady pace all semester.
